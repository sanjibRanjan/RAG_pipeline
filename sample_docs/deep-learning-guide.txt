# Deep Learning Guide

## Introduction to Deep Learning

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to model complex patterns in data.

## Neural Network Architecture

### Input Layer
Receives the initial data and passes it to hidden layers.

### Hidden Layers
Process the data through weighted connections and activation functions.
- **Dense Layers**: Fully connected neurons
- **Convolutional Layers**: Process spatial data (images)
- **Recurrent Layers**: Handle sequential data (text, time series)

### Output Layer
Produces the final prediction or classification.

## Key Components

### Neurons
Basic units that receive inputs, apply weights, and produce outputs through activation functions.

### Weights and Biases
Parameters that the network learns during training.
- **Weights**: Connection strengths between neurons
- **Biases**: Offset values that help the model fit better

### Activation Functions
Introduce non-linearity into the network:
- **ReLU**: Rectified Linear Unit, most commonly used
- **Sigmoid**: For binary classification
- **Softmax**: For multi-class classification
- **Tanh**: Hyperbolic tangent function

## Training Process

### Forward Propagation
Data flows from input to output layer, generating predictions.

### Loss Function
Measures the difference between predicted and actual values:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: For regression
- **Cross-Entropy Loss**: For classification

### Backpropagation
Algorithm that calculates gradients and updates weights to minimize loss.

### Optimization Algorithms
Methods to update weights efficiently:
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**
- **Adam**: Adaptive moment estimation
- **RMSprop**: Root mean square propagation
