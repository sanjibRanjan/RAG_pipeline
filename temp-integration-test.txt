# RAG Pipeline Integration Test Document

## Overview
This document serves as a test case for the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline integration test. It contains various types of content to validate the system's ability to process, chunk, and retrieve information effectively.

## Key Features
The RAG pipeline includes several critical components:

1. **Document Processing**: Converts documents into searchable chunks
2. **Embedding Generation**: Creates vector representations using Hugging Face models
3. **Vector Storage**: Stores embeddings in ChromaDB for similarity search
4. **Document Storage**: Manages parent chunks in memory for hierarchical retrieval
5. **Language Model Integration**: Uses Gemini API for answer generation
6. **Question Answering**: Combines retrieval and generation for comprehensive responses

## Technical Architecture
The system uses a hierarchical chunking approach where:
- Parent chunks (1024 characters) provide broader context
- Child chunks (256 characters) enable precise retrieval
- Vector store contains only child chunks for efficient similarity search
- Document store maintains parent chunks for context expansion

## Testing Scenarios
This document enables testing of:
- Document ingestion and processing
- Chunk generation and storage
- Vector similarity search
- Context retrieval and expansion
- Answer generation with confidence scoring

## Expected Outcomes
When processing this document, the system should:
- Generate multiple parent and child chunks
- Store embeddings in ChromaDB
- Enable semantic search capabilities
- Provide accurate answers to questions about the content

## Conclusion
This integration test validates the complete RAG pipeline functionality, ensuring all services work together harmoniously to deliver accurate, context-aware responses to user queries.
