He’s an excellent editor,\nand it has been a pleasure working with him. (He is also largely responsible for\nthis book, probably much more so than most editors, for it was he who adroitly\nsidestepped my initial proposal to write a book on an entirely different topic,\nand gently suggested that I might like to consider writing something about the\nrelationship between CA and DA. So it's his fault, really.)\nThere is a community of scholars whose work has had an important influ-\nence  on  my  own, and  their  research  figures  prominently  in  the  pages  which\nfollow;  and whose company at various conferences around the world has been",

First, it  sets  out  to  introduce  conversation\nanalysis  (CA)  and  discourse  analysis  (DA)  as  methodological  approaches  to\nthe study of talk, both of which have far-reaching implications for our under-\nstanding of social interaction and the role of discourse and communication in\neveryday life.\nConversation  analysis  is  one  of  the  key  methodological  approaches  to  the\nstudy  of  verbal  interaction, and  this  is  one  of  the  reasons  that  it  is  given  so\nmuch prominence in this book. But there are other approaches to the study\nof  discourse  and  communication  which  can  be  applied  to  face-to-face  or\ntelephone  interaction: of  course  there  is  discourse  analysis; but  there  is  also\ndiscursive  psychology, rhetorical  psychology, speech  act  theory, critical  dis-\ncourse analysis and Foucauldian forms of discourse analysis, or the analysis of\ndiscourses.

This provides\nsome  historical  background,  and  allows  us  to  identify  just  how  novel  and\nradical  these  developments  were: they  offered  new  ways  of  doing  sociology,\nand placed the empirical study of communication at the heart of the social sci-\nence enterprise. We start with conversation analysis.\nConversation analysis\nThe mode of analysis which subsequently grew into CA began with a puzzle.\nThe style of work which has come to be known as conversation analysis\nis  associated  with  the  pioneering  research  of  Harvey  Sacks. As  Schegloff\nreports  in  his  introduction  to  the  published  collection  of  Sacks’  lectures\n(Schegloff, 1992a), Sacks  had  been  examining  a  corpus  of  recorded  tele-\nphone calls to the Los Angeles Suicide Prevention Center.

For\nthe Center, then, the problem was getting callers to reveal their names.\nSchegloff notes that for Sacks, however, a different issue became pressing.\nDisplaying  the  original  and  distinctive  approach  that  came  to  characterise\nhis  work, Sacks  began  to  wonder  ‘where, in  the  course  of  the  conversation\ncould  you  tell  that  somebody  would  not  give  their  name’  (1992, vol.

For example, it suggests that spoken language works\nmerely to deliver particles of information; moreover, it implies that these pack-",

We can analyse these deviant cases to\ninvestigate how participants’ utterances display their understanding of the sig-\nnificance of that departure. So, if someone displays that they are ‘noticing’ the\nabsence of a certain type of turn from a co-participant, then that demonstrates\ntheir own orientation to the normative expectation that it should have been\nproduced.\nTo illustrate this, look at this fragment which we discussed in Chapter 2, in\nwhich a question is not followed by an answer.\nMETHOD AND CRITIQUE61\nWoofit-03.qxd  2/16/2005  11:55 AM  Page 61",

These skills are referred to as ‘tacit’ and ‘practical’ because they\nare not the kinds of ‘rules’ or norms of behaviour which we could consciously\narticulate, or on which we would routinely reflect.

Discourse  analytic  projects, however, consider  a  much\nwider  range  of  empirical  materials:  in  the  previous  chapter  we  discussed\nstudies  in  which  the  analysts  had  examined  newspaper  articles, statements\nmade by politicians in the House of Commons, and accounts generated from\ninformal  interviews. And  in  the  later  chapter  on  critical  approaches  to  dis-\ncourse  analysis  we  will  encounter  an  argument  that  analysts  should  analyse\ntexts: any  events, objects  or  processes  which  are  imbued  with  meaning  and\nsubject  to  interpretation. This  broadens  considerably  the  range  of  materials\ndiscourse analysts can examine as data in their research.\nSIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES85\nWoofit-04.qxd  2/15/2005  10:45 AM  Page 85",

Why is this? There are several reasons.\nFirst, discourse analysis grew from the sociological study of scientific knowl-\nedge. This  approach  adopted  a  radical  position  in  that  it  did  not  accept  the\northodox scientific consensus that some knowledge claims were simply true,\nand others were simply false. Instead, it sought to expose and investigate the\nsocial  processes  which  informed  the  way  in  which  the  scientific  community\ncame  to  regard  some  knowledge  claims  as  objective  representations  of  the\nphysical  world  and  others  as  errors,  or  false  claims.

Moreover, we might be tempted\nto  regard  these  formulations  as  ‘uncertainty  markers’, thus  underlining  the\ncognitive psychological perspective that language use is ultimately a represen-\ntation of inner cognitive states or psychological processes.\nThe  discourse  view,  however,  treats  ‘I  dunno’  formulations  as  activities\nproduced  to  address  particular  kinds  of  interpersonal  work. In  his  study  of\ninteraction in relationship counselling sessions, Edwards (1995a) showed how\n‘I don’t know’ was used by a man reporting his partner’s clothing to display a\nlack  of  concern  for  the  topic, when  disclosing  such  close  monitoring  could\nitself be cited as warranting accusations of overbearing jealousy. ‘I don’t know’ or",

So, for  example, there  is  a  shift  from  thinking\nabout ‘memory’ as a set of storage facilities hardwired into the physiological\nstructures of the brain, towards the study of discourse in which people offer\nrecollections. Second, there  is  the  study  of  the  psychological  thesaurus: the\nways in which psychological terms are used to perform work in discourse. So,\nour  observations  on  the  use  of  ‘I  think’  and  ‘I  dunno’  would  fall  into  this\ncategory. Finally, there  is  the  study  of  the  ways  in  which  discourse  is  used  to\nmanage implied psychological themes.

He found that it is used to exhibit that\nthe speaker has undergone a change of state, for example, in response to being\ninformed of some state of affairs. However, he is not making the claim that this\nparticle is a public display of some real change at a cognitive or mental level.\nAs  he  points  out,  there  are  occasions  when  informings  occur  but  are  not\nmarked  with  ‘oh’  receipts. For  example, in  medical  consultations  and  news\ninterviews there are occasions in which one participant informs another, but\nthese kinds of interaction are distinctive because of the absenceof ‘oh’ parti-\ncles. This strongly suggests that its occurrence is constrained by, and oriented\nto, the interactional contingencies of particular social contexts.",

He examines a sequence in which one of the group is\nreporting on a television programme he has recently watched. While making\nthis report, the speaker seems to forget momentarily the name of the show’s\nhost. Instead of treating this ostensible lapse in memory as an indication of a\ncognitive or psychological aberration, Goodwin investigates the ‘forgetting’ as\na display of ‘not remembering’, and focuses on its sequential placement to see\nwhat kinds of work it performs in that setting. His subsequent analysis reveals\nthat the spate of not remembering allows the speaker to warrant and facilitate\nthe  involvement  of  a  co-participant  in  the  telling  of  a  story.

But the topic of the\ndebate could have been formulated very differently, for example, as a debate\nabout Mr Ray Honeyford and his disparaging articles about Asian students in\nmulti-cultural  education, which  would, in  all  likelihood, have  led  to  a  very\ndifferent kind of debate. When he examines superstructures: text schemata,van\nDijk  unpicks  the  argumentative  propositions  and  moves  Fox  makes. So, for\nexample, he shows how Fox builds an implicit contrast between Honeyford’s\naction  (he  wrote  an  article  for  a  ‘small  circulation  publication’)  and  the\nresponse (‘a holocaust on his head’). This depicts the response as unwarranted\nand  unfair.

(Parker, 1994: 94)\nDiscourses  have  two  important  effects. First, they  constrain  how  we  might\nparticipate in social life because they furnish subject positions. A subject posi-\ntion is ‘a part allocated to a person by the use of a story’ (Stenner, 1993: 114).\nThus Foucauldian discourse analysts ‘study texts ... to show how ... discourses\nfacilitate and limit, enable and constrain what can be said (by whom, where,",

The first set of critical objections revolves around the argu-\nment that CA either does not, or cannot, address the kinds of topics which are\ncentral to traditional sociological inquiry: for example, the analysis of conflict, the\nmanifestation of power and inequality in social relationship and mobilisation of\ndisadvantage  based  on  gender, ethnicity  or  class. The  second  broad  argument  is\nthat  the  methodological  procedures  of  conversation  analysis  are  in  some  key\nrespects  deficient: that  it  fails  to  take  account  of  the  essentially  argumentative\nnature  of  everyday  discourse, focusing  instead  on  the  management  of  interper-\nsonal  harmony  and  accord; or  that  its  focus  on  the  ‘technical’  aspects  of  the\nsequential  organisation  of  turn-taking  means  that  it  cannot  address  the  wider",

This is important because it marks\na  distinction  between  conversation  analysis  and  those  forms  of  discourse\nanalysis which are focused on ideological or rhetorical struggles.\nUnlike  conversation  analysis, discourse  analysis  regards  social  life  as  being\ncharacterised  by  conflicts  of  various  kinds.  As  such,  much  discourse  is\ninvolved in establishing one version of the world in the face of competing\nversions.

To  this  end  she  suggested\nthat  post-structuralist  approaches  could  benefit  from  CA’s  strict  attention  to\nthe detail of talk-in-interaction (see also Edley and Wetherell, 1999). Echoing\nSchegloff’s  (1997)  critique  of  critical  discourse  analysis,  she  argued  that\ntheoretically informed scholars tended to offer cursory analyses of their data, on\nthe basis of which they were advancing claims about the operation of discourse\nand subject positions.

This  is  because\ndiscourses  (and  repertoires  and  ideologies)  are  constitutive. They  construct\nobjects: entities or processes which acquire an objective status through the use\nof particular vocabularies (Edley, 2001; Edley and Wetherell, 1999). Moreover,\ndiscourses provide subject positions which circumscribe the range of identities\nand  relationships  available  to  individuals. On  the  basis  of  this  view  of  com-\nmunication, it is argued that CA’s attempt to ground analytic claims solely by\nreference to what can be demonstrated empirically leads to an impoverished\nand politically etiolated view of social life (Wetherell, 1998).\nSo  how  powerful  are  these  arguments?

This is because its distinctive methodology – specifically\nits rejection of premature theorising – and its focus on the detailed analysis of\nthe organisation of interaction as a topic in its own right, has led its critics to\nargue that it fails to address the range of issues traditionally studied by sociolo-\ngists. Thus it does not try to conceptualise its data in terms of the theoretical\nstances currently influential in the discipline. Furthermore, it does not try to\nmake links between the micro-phenomena of interaction and what might be\ncalled macro-level order, in which relations of power, the role of ideologies and\nthe influence of history and cultural values are said to operate.\nThis critique has become more pronounced in the past twenty-five years as\nresearchers  in  other  disciplines  have  become  interested  in  what  were  once",

But\nthis question is not designed to solicit expressions of intent to buy; ‘’oo can use\n’em if ah go a bit lower,’ merely asks the audience to consider their potential\nattractiveness at an as yet unspecified price.

We are initially exposed to a ‘field \nof availables’ but, in order to form relationships, we must narrow down this field into a ‘field of \ndesirables’, using the 3 filters of social demography, similarity in attitudes and complementarity. The \nimportance of each filter depends on whether the relationship is short-term or long-term.  \n•\nThe first filter is social demography, and describes the factors which can make potential partners \nattractive to us. Key to this is the idea of similarity in terms of these factors which include religion, \nsexuality, ethnicity, social class, educational attainment and proximity. Two people sharing similar \nsocial demographic features are more likely to find each other attractive. Nevertheless, proximity is \nkey because it provides accessibility, which makes communication and relationship formation",

Online communications, due to \nthe apparent lack of nonverbal cues, often feature ‘direct’ questions, as opposed to the small-talk \nwhich features in face-to-face relationships. Therefore, this suggests that we are actually more likely \nto self-disclose in virtual relationships because we can be selective as to what information we reveal \nabout ourselves, and so use self-disclosure to further improve the way that a potential partner views \nus. Hence, the central principle of selective self-presentation and the importance on anonymity are \ndemonstrated in such studies.  \n— The theories of self-disclosure and absence of gating in virtual relationships may lack ecological \nvalidity because they may not be able to explain all the course of modern-age relationships, which is",
